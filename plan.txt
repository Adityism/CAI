Here is the comprehensive plan for executing the task of running the app:

### Plan:
1. **Check Ollama Service**: 
   - Use the `check_ollama.py` file to verify if the Ollama service is running. If it is not running, attempt to start it.

2. **Ensure DeepSeek Model is Pulled**: 
   - Confirm that the DeepSeek model is available. If it is not, pull the model using the appropriate API call.

3. **Run the Flask Application**: 
   - Start the Flask application using the `run.py` file, ensuring that it runs on the specified host and port.

4. **Logging**: 
   - Throughout the process, log important information and errors to help diagnose any issues that may arise.

5. **SSL Configuration**: 
   - Ensure that SSL certificate files are present and generate them if they do not exist.

### Follow-up Steps:
- After running the app, verify that it is accessible via the specified URL and that all endpoints are functioning correctly.
